                <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0; text-align: justify;">Mahabaleshwar is a stunning hill station nestled in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, located in the Satara district. At
                an altitude of about 1,353 meters (4,439 feet) above sea level, it offers a refreshing escape with its pleasant climate,

            <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">üèõÔ∏è Gateway of India ‚Äì The Majestic Symbol of Mumbai</h3>
            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"> The Gateway of India is one of the most iconic landmarks of Mumbai and a symbol of India‚Äôs colonial past and independent
            spirit. Located on the waterfront in Colaba, overlooking the Arabian Sea, it is often the first sight that welcomes
            visitors arriving by sea.
            
            Built in 1911, the foundation of the Gateway was laid to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India.
            The construction was completed in 1924 and designed by architect George Wittet in an Indo-Saracenic style, blending
            elements of Hindu and Islamic architecture. Made of yellow basalt and concrete, the arch stands 26 meters (85 feet) high
            and boasts intricate latticework and grand pillars.
            
            The Gateway holds great historical significance. It was from this very spot in 1948 that the last British troops
            departed India, marking the end of British rule. Since then, it has become a symbol of India‚Äôs independence and
            resilience.
