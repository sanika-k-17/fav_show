            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is celebrated with great enthusiasm across Maharashtra. It marks the victory of light
            over darkness and good over evil. Diwali begins with Vasu Baras and Dhanteras, followed by Narak Chaturdashi, Lakshmi
            Pujan, Padwa, and Bhaubeej, each day having cultural and spiritual significance.
            
            Homes are cleaned and decorated with diyas (oil lamps), colorful rangoli, and flowers. Firecrackers light up the night
            sky. On Lakshmi Pujan, families worship Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth, for prosperity and well-being.
            
            Traditional sweets like karanji, chakli, laddu, and shankarpali are prepared and shared. Diwali also includes gifting,
            new clothes, and exchanging warm wishes. For Maharashtrians, Padwa is celebrated as Bali Pratipada, symbolizing the
            return of King Bali to earth, while Bhaubeej highlights the special bond between brothers and sisters.
            
            Diwali in Maharashtra is not just a religious festival; it‚Äôs a vibrant celebration of life, culture, and togetherness.

            <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Makar Sankranti is a harvest festival celebrated in mid-January to mark the sun‚Äôs transition into Capricorn (Makara
            Rashi). In Maharashtra, it‚Äôs a festival of gratitude, charity, and sweetness.
            
            People exchange tilgul‚Äîsesame and jaggery sweets‚Äîwith the words ‚ÄúTilgul ghya, god god bola‚Äù, meaning ‚ÄúAccept this sweet
            and speak sweetly.‚Äù These ingredients symbolize warmth during the cold season and bonding in relationships.
            
            Women celebrate Haldi-Kumkum, inviting married women to their homes for rituals and gifting. Children fly colorful kites
            in the sky, and competitions are held in towns and villages.
            
            The festival emphasizes unity and kindness. It‚Äôs also associated with giving donations (daan) to the needy and wearing
            black clothes to absorb warmth.
            
            Makar Sankranti in Maharashtra combines spiritual significance, social bonding, and the joy of harvest, making it a
            unique and meaningful celebration.

                <h3 style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">üåü Janmashtami ‚Äì Celebration of Lord Krishna‚Äôs Birth
                </h3>
                <p style=" padding: 20px; padding-top: 0; text-align: justify;">Janmashtami, also known as Gokulashtami in Maharashtra, celebrates the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of
                Vishnu. Observed in the month of Shravan (August), this festival is especially popular in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, and
                across the Konkan region.
                
                One of the most iconic aspects of Janmashtami in Maharashtra is the Dahi Handi celebration. It recreates Lord Krishna‚Äôs
                childhood act of stealing butter (makhan). Young boys, called Govindas, form human pyramids to break a high-hanging
                earthen pot filled with curd, butter, or dry fruits‚Äîoften accompanied by cheering crowds and energetic music.
                
                The event is full of thrill and team spirit. Communities and sponsors organize large-scale Dahi Handi competitions with
                prize money and safety measures, attracting both local groups and professional teams.
                
                At homes and temples, devotees fast, sing bhajans, and perform midnight aarti, marking the exact time of Krishna‚Äôs
                birth. Krishna idols are bathed, dressed in new clothes, and placed in decorated cradles.
                
                Sweets like pedha, shrikhanda, and makkhan mishri are prepared and offered to the deity. The festival blends devotion,
                joy, physical activity, and cultural pride, especially for the youth.
                
                Janmashtami in Maharashtra is not just a spiritual observance; it‚Äôs a colorful, community-centered event that showcases
                the energy, devotion, and vibrant culture of the state.</p>
